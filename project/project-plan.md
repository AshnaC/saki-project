# Project Plan

## Summary

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->

The Project explores time series data sets of Road Traffic Accidents and fine for speeding information for the city of Konstanz. The project will try to find the existence any correlation between these two series and understand any steps that can be taken to reduce the number of accidents.
The project also aims to predict future Accident Information using time series analysis.
There are also several other data sources (like weather information) available that can be utilized to make better predictions.
